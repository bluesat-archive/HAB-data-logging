## Sensor data-logging scripts for BLUEsat HAB Mission 

Give scripts execute permissions by typing "chmod +x filename.sh"

Run bash scripts by typing "./filename.sh"

Run python scripts by typing "python filename.py" from a terminal

Run python scripts in the background by adding an ampersand: "python filename.py &"

Note: Within each sensor's directory, a folder called "data" must exist since this is where the Python scripts save CSV files
